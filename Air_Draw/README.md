<strong>Air_Draw</strong> is a simple, yet cool tool that takes in feed from your webcam, and enables you to draw in the air with your index finger, while allowing you to choose various features, like colours, thickness, etc as if you were drawing with your mouse/cursor in Ms Paint.

<strong>How to use it?</strong>
The key idea is to detect the tips of index and middle finger of a hand, and use that data to allow one switch to choose or draw mode.

You are in drawing mode when only your index finger is up. Your index finger's tip would act like the paint brush. The circular cursor colour will indicate the brush colour currently selected.

When you want to select a particular feature, you have to open both your index and middle fingers, and join them. Then, you have to hover the circular cursor on the desired feature.

You also have an eraser in case you want to remove a certain portion of your drawing.

Once you are done drawing, you can save your image by hovering your two fingers on "Save".
To clear the screen, you have to hover on "Clear All".

The most interesting feature of this is that, you can choose your background. It can either be a live background, or a simple black canvas.
