Work done by me as a core member of Epoch, the AI & ML club at IITH.

draw.py is the code for a fun activity called "Air-draw" which enables you to draw in the air with your index finger. The code uses mediapipe hands api to detect the index finger. Its underlying pipeline mechanism uses a palm detection model followed by hand landmark model.
